# **Fiacre Rider App**
Fiacre is a simple e-hailing platform which connects riders and drivers, at a more affordable rate than the regular taxicab. In this case we will be looking at the Riders side of things (click [Fiacre Driver App](https://github.com/MathabatheTokelo/Driver-App.git) to check out the drivers side).
